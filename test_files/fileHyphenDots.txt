Facts Despite a warning from plaintiff not to do so defendant rode over and hunted deer on plaintiff 19s unenclosed and unimproved lands. Procedural History A jury found that each party should pay their own costs and plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground that riding over unenclosed and unimproved lands is an actionable trespass when it is contrary to the express orders of the landowner. Issue Does an individual have the right to hunt on unenclosed and uncultivated lands without incurring liability for trespass even over the objection of the property owner? Holding / Rule Yes. Hunters have a right to hunt on unenclosed and unimproved lands. Reasoning The right to hunt on unenclosed uncultivated lands has long been recognized and exercised. It has been both a source of sustenance and profit for many hunters. The forest has been regarded as a common and animals (ferae naturae) common property belonging to the first taker.  1cIf therefore usage can make law none was ever better established. 1d Moreover there must be some injury to support a trespass action 14merely riding over the soil is not sufficient. The right to hunt on unenclosed lands also has social benefits i.e. training of militias. Nor should disapproval of the property owner deprive a hunter of a right the law grants him.

Held. No. Judgment affirmed and cause remanded. * Necessity will justify entries upon land and interferences with personal property that would otherwise have been trespass. The court gave a few illustrations to illustrate the doctrine of necessity: * A traveler on a highway who finds it obstructed from a sudden and temporary cause may pass upon the adjoining land without becoming a trespasser because of necessity. Entry upon land to save goods which are in danger of being lost or destroyed is not a trespass. * Necessity applies with special force to the preservation of human life. One assaulted and in peril of his life may run through the land of another to escape from his assailant. One may sacrifice the personal property of another to save his life or the lives of his fellows. * In this case Plaintiff entered the land of Defendant in effort to escape the storm and avoid injury. Defendant claims that Plaintiff could have tied his boat to natural objects with equal safety. However the facts show that Plaintiff tied his boat to Defendant 19s dock to save the boat and the people in it. The requirements of the claim for necessity are complete. Yet the rule of necessity cannot be held applicable irrespective of circumstances. The question of circumstances and natural objects is left for adjudication.
